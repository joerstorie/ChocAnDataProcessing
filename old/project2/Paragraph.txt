The ChocAn data software will handle the management of member and provider information, as well as the weekly and as-requested logging of reports. The software will computerize reports by logging them as files. This data will be stored as a variety of objects in persistent storage, meaning that this project will require one or more hard drives with an appropriate size depending on the expected amount of members and providers and the frequency of services. The system will communicate remotely with providers, operators, and managers via terminal systems of choice. This will allow the users to conveniently and securely send and receive necessary information from the software.
